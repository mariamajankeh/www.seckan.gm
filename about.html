                <p>
                    Hi! my name is Jankeh Secka.I was born in fajikunda hospital, I am 21 years old. I used to lived in Tallinding with my whole family but later moved into Bakau due to the death of my dad. Now I'm currently living in Bakau with mum and siblings. i spent most of my childhood in Tallinding, I am single. 
                    I did my nursery schooling in 2005 at BOJANG NURSERY SCHOOL, in 2014 i finished my primary schooling at LATRIKUNDA LOWER BASIC SCHOOL, in 2017 i sat for the GABECE Examination at BAKAU SCHOOL then in 2020 i sat for my WASSCE Examination. After some months i started to persue my dream course which is COMPUTER SCIENCE at MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE M.D.I am now doing my Natioanl deploma in computer science and probably by the end of this year i will finish my two year course. i will love to go to the UK to further my I.T career as WEB DEVELOPER AND PROGRAMMER.
                </p>

                    The worst day of my life was the day i lost my dad. It was on Tuesday evening 2015, it is a day i will never forget in my entire life. He was everthing to me, my closest friend, my hero and my adviser. i couldn't imagine life without him by my side, i wished he was still around  to see how her girl is full filling her dreams.
                </P>
